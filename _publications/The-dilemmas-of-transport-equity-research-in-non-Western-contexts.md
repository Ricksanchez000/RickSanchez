This paper critically evaluates the prevailing conceptualisations in transport equity research, emphasising the inadvertent Eurocentrism inherent in many contemporary frameworks. By distinguishing between social equality and social equity, the paper underscores the need for differentiated treatments in varied contexts to truly achieve fairness.

Central to this discourse is the assertion that the prevailing Eurocentric models may misrepresent or oversimplify non-Western contexts, particularly in regions with complex societal structures and cultural nuances, such as China. Drawing from Chinaâ€™s experiences, the paper illustrates the potential pitfalls of uncritically adopting Western transport equity theories, revealing how they can lead to significant misunderstandings. These inaccuracies are often perpetuated by a reliance on reductionist methodologies that do not account for the serpentine regional challenges and cultural dynamics unique to non-Western nations. Therefore, I advocate for an evolved, contextually apt approach to transport equity research that is sensitive to cultural and regional intricacies, ensuring a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of transport equity dynamics in global contexts.

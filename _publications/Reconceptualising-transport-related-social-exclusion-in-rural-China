In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to elucidate transport-related social exclusion (TRSE) in rural China. Drawing from participant observations across 146 villages in Guangdong (2643 rural residents), we illuminate the multifaceted nature of TRSE in Chinese villages. In term of interregional transport challenges, rural residents are socially excluded due to inadequate transport infrastructure and services. In contrast, within the microcosm of intravillage transport, residents adeptly harness available transport resources to craft exclusionary strategies.

This emergent form of TRSE, distinct from previous paradigms, sees villagers deploying transport as an instrument to deliberately exclude the Other based on the depth and nuances of their interpersonal relationships. This exclusion manifests through unique characteristics: the nebulous contours of marginalised groups, mutual exclusion between rural residents, ethical ambivalence, and its profound resonance with traditional cultural norms. Given the intricate layers that seem to eclipse the phenomena observed in urban contexts, we underscore the imperative for a more nuanced exploration of TRSE in rural landscapes.
